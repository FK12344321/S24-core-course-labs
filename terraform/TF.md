## Best practices 
1. All the terraform files are stored in github, so it can help revert to the previous states and not to loose important configurations 
2. Command `terraform import` was used to drag github resources under management of terraform \
3. Resources are logically split up into diffrent files such as `variables.tf`, `output.tf`, etc 
4. Different infrastructures are managed by different folders: docker, aws, github 

## Docker 

**terraform state list**
```
docker_container.nginx <br>
docker_image.nginx
```

**terraform state show docker_container.nginx**
```

## Github 

Firstly, I created a demo repository with main branch protection. And here is the result of `terraform apply`
```bash
var.token
  Specifies the GitHub PAT token or `GITHUB_TOKEN`

  Enter a value: 

github_repository.S24-core-course-labs: Refreshing state... [id=S24-core-course-labs]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following
symbols:
  + create
  ~ update in-place

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # github_branch_default.main will be created
  + resource "github_branch_default" "main" {
      + branch     = "main"
      + id         = (known after apply)

Plan: 3 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes   

github_repository.devops_s23_demo: Creating...
github_repository.S24-core-course-labs: Modifying... [id=S24-core-course-labs]
github_repository.S24-core-course-labs: Modifications complete after 8s [id=S24-core-course-labs]

```

### Created repo 
The repo created by the command can be found [here](https://github.com/FK12344321/Demo-DevOps-S23-repo)

### Import 
After that I imported my local repo so it gets managed by github

```bash
fedorkrasilnikov@Fedors-MBP github % terraform import "github_repository.S24-core-course-labs" "S24-core-course-labs"
var.token
  Specifies the GitHub PAT token or `GITHUB_TOKEN`

  Enter a value: 

github_repository.S24-core-course-labs: Importing from ID "S24-core-course-labs"...
github_repository.S24-core-course-labs: Import prepared!
  Prepared github_repository for import
github_repository.S24-core-course-labs: Refreshing state... [id=S24-core-course-labs]

Import successful!

The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now in
your Terraform state and will henceforth be managed by Terraform.
```

## Github teams 
I created an organization https://github.com/S24-demo-org. After that I set up 1 repo 2 teams with different permissions in that organization. Everything except for the org creation was accomplished with terraform. Here is the result of `terraform show`

```
